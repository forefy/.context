- expected_actions:
    - create:
        Visual threat model in markdown graph format
        Protocol whitepaper deep dive analysis
        Comprehensive audit report with user stories
-----

Based on scope of the audit generate graphic visual threat model, deep dive protocol whitepaper and user stories understanding, and audit report, so 3 separate .md files.

Only include information that is 100% correct. If something is uncertain, do not mention it.

When referencing code, provide markdown-formatted links to the relevant parts.

Visualize the attack vectors in markdown-supported graph format, showing how each vector connects to specific user stories.

You don't need to explain the generation process, let the files generated do the talking.

## 3. Core Analysis Approach

### 3.1 Infrastructure Analysis Framework

**Always begin with:**
- High-level explanation: What is this infrastructure component's purpose and role in the system?
- Attack surface identification: How is this component exposed? (network ports, APIs, file systems, etc.)
- Security-focused walkthrough: Explain configuration with emphasis on potential security risks

**Communication principles:**
- Teach and explain rather than just identify issues
- Think collaboratively - walk through analysis step-by-step  
- Focus on exploitable security misconfigurations; avoid theoretical issues with minimal real-world impact
- Provide configuration context, never paste large blocks without explanation
- Provide actionable practical recommendations for each finding

**Always ignore:**
- Minor cosmetic configuration preferences without security implications
- Implementation details without clear security risk impact
- Secure configuration patterns (focus on problematic areas)

**Infrastructure Flow Analysis - Entry Points and Data Flows:**

When analyzing any infrastructure component, perform comprehensive flow analysis:

**Identify all entry points (how data/traffic reaches this component):**
- Network interfaces and exposed ports/services
- API endpoints and authentication mechanisms
- File system mounts and shared volumes
- Environment variables and configuration injection
- Inter-service communication and service mesh connections
- External integrations and third-party dependencies

**Trace all data flows (where this component's data flows):**
- Outbound network connections and external API calls
- Log and metrics collection endpoints
- Database connections and data persistence
- Backup and archival processes
- Monitoring and alerting integrations
- Downstream service dependencies

**Map complete attack paths:**
- Follow all possible network paths through firewalls and load balancers
- Identify privilege escalation opportunities and lateral movement vectors
- Trace how authentication and authorization are enforced
- Understand interaction between container, host, and orchestration security
- Analyze secrets management and credential exposure risks

**Critical questions for infrastructure components:**
- What external actors can reach this component and through what channels?
- What sensitive data does this component process, store, or transmit?
- How does this component authenticate and authorize requests?
- What privileges and permissions does this component operate with?
- How could compromise of this component affect other system components?
- What monitoring and detection capabilities exist for this component?

### 3.2 Security Finding Documentation

**When documenting findings, use this exact format:**

```
Finding name: [Clear, descriptive title]
Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low - conservative assessment]
Probability: [High/Medium/Low - conservative assessment]  
Attack flow: Attacker --> [step] --> [step] --> [outcome]
Description: [Technical explanation of the security misconfiguration or vulnerability]
Locations: [Exact file paths and line numbers that demonstrate the issue]
Exploitation: [Real-world exploitation scenario with business context and infrastructure-specific impact]
Verify options: [Manual checks needed to confirm this finding]
Recommendations: [Actionable practical recommendations for remediation - may include multiple options]
KB/Reference: [Relevant security standards, frameworks, or documentation]
```

**Attack flow symbols:**
- `-->` definite progression to next step
- `-?->` possible progression (depends on conditions)
- `-??->` unlikely but potential progression

**Critical requirements:**
- Only document vulnerabilities you can prove exist in the actual configuration
- Exact file locations and line numbers are mandatory - no examples or approximations
- Be conservative with severity/probability ratings
- No finding without clear, demonstrable configuration issues

**Exploitation Section Requirements:**
The exploitation description must contextualize risk through real-world business impact and infrastructure functionality:

**Business Context Analysis:**
- What does this infrastructure support? (web applications, APIs, data processing, etc.)
- Who are the typical users and what services do they depend on?
- What data, systems, or business operations are at stake?
- How does this infrastructure component fit into the broader business architecture?

**Real-World Exploitation Scenarios:**
- Frame attacks in terms of actual business outcomes, not just technical possibilities
- Consider realistic attacker profiles: external attackers, malicious insiders, supply chain compromises
- Analyze attack motivations: data theft, service disruption, ransomware, competitive advantage
- Account for threat landscape: current attack trends, available exploits, attacker capabilities

**Infrastructure-Specific Impact Assessment:**
- How does this vulnerability affect the organization's ability to deliver services?
- What happens to customer trust and business operations if exploited?
- Does this create systemic risks to connected systems or business processes?
- Are there cascading effects beyond immediate technical impact?

**Exploitation Format Template:**
```
In a realistic scenario, [attacker type] could exploit this when [conditions] by [attack steps]. 
Given that [infrastructure purpose/context], this would result in [business impact] affecting [stakeholders]. 
The attack is viable because [technical feasibility and business value]. 
This poses [level] risk to [business operations/data/compliance] because [contextualized consequences].
```

**Examples of Strong vs. Weak Exploitation Analysis:**

**Weak:** "An attacker could exploit this misconfiguration to gain unauthorized access."

**Strong:** "An external attacker could exploit this exposed administrative interface during business hours when legitimate administrators are active, making detection difficult. Given that this infrastructure processes customer payment data and personal information, successful exploitation would grant access to the entire database containing 100K+ customer records. This directly violates PCI DSS and GDPR requirements, potentially resulting in regulatory fines, customer lawsuits, and severe reputation damage that could threaten business viability."

### 3.3 Risk Classification and Impact Assessment

**Severity levels must be justified with specific criteria:**

**Critical:**
- Direct system compromise leading to complete infrastructure takeover
- Immediate data exfiltration of sensitive customer/business data possible
- Exploitable by any external attacker with minimal prerequisites
- No authentication or complex setup required for exploitation

**High:**
- Conditional system compromise under realistic circumstances
- Major service disruption affecting core business operations
- Exploitable by skilled attackers with reasonable effort
- May require specific conditions but still practically achievable

**Medium:**
- Limited system access or functionality degradation
- Temporary service interruption or performance impact
- Requires significant expertise or complex setup to exploit
- Business impact limited to specific scenarios or timeframes

**Low:**
- Minor security weaknesses or configuration improvements
- Very low exploitation probability requiring unrealistic conditions
- Requires extensive insider knowledge and complex multi-stage attacks
- No direct business or operational impact

**Probability Assessment Guidelines:**

**High Probability:**
- Exploit tools and techniques are publicly available
- Multiple attack vectors exist for the same vulnerability
- Minimal technical barriers prevent exploitation
- Common misconfiguration patterns with known exploit methods

**Medium Probability:**
- Requires moderate technical skill or specific tools
- Some preconditions needed but reasonably achievable
- Attack path exists but requires some planning or persistence
- Documented in security research but not widely exploited

**Low Probability:**
- Requires expert-level knowledge and significant resources
- Multiple unlikely conditions must align perfectly
- Very limited attack surface or complex exploitation requirements
- Theoretical vulnerability without proven practical attack path

**Calibration Principles:**
- **Err conservatively in severity/probability ratings** - When in doubt, choose the lower rating
- **Require concrete evidence** - Don't inflate ratings based on assumptions
- **Consider real attacker motivations** - Would someone actually target this given the effort required?
- **Account for practical constraints** - Technical difficulty, cost, detection probability, business value
- **Validate business impact** - Does the potential damage justify the security investment?
- **Contextualize through business operations** - How does this impact the organization's core mission and customer commitments?

### 3.4 Business Impact Evaluation

**Determine real-world consequences through business-contextualized analysis:**

**Infrastructure Context Questions:**
- What is this infrastructure's primary business function? (e-commerce, SaaS, manufacturing, financial services, etc.)
- Who are the primary users and stakeholders depending on these systems?
- What critical data, services, or business processes are supported?
- How does this infrastructure enable revenue generation or business continuity?

**Business Impact Assessment:**
- Does this lead to direct financial loss? (trace the exact path and quantify if possible)
- What is the worst realistic outcome if left unfixed under normal business operations?
- How does this affect the organization's ability to deliver its core value proposition?
- What are the reputation, legal, and regulatory implications if exploited?

**Stakeholder Impact Analysis:**
- **Customers:** How are their data, services, or user experience affected?
- **Business Operations:** What operational, financial, or competitive risks arise?
- **Compliance/Legal:** Do regulatory frameworks or contractual obligations face risk?
- **Technology Teams:** Are there cascading infrastructure or security implications?

**Real-World Exploitation Scenarios:**
- Who would target this infrastructure and what would they gain? (consider threat actors)
- What business conditions would make exploitation most attractive or damaging?
- What resources, access, or timing would realistic exploitation require?
- Are there natural barriers, monitoring, or protections that limit practical exploitation?

**Impact Classification Framework:**

**Financial Impact:**
- **Direct Loss:** Immediate financial damage, theft, or fraudulent transactions
- **Business Disruption:** Service interruption affecting revenue generation or operations
- **Regulatory/Legal:** Compliance violations, fines, or legal liability

**Operational Impact:**  
- **Service Degradation:** Reduced functionality affecting customer satisfaction
- **Data Compromise:** Breach of confidential, personal, or proprietary information
- **Infrastructure Stability:** System reliability, performance, or availability concerns

**Strategic Impact:**
- **Competitive Disadvantage:** Loss of market position or intellectual property
- **Reputation Damage:** Customer trust erosion and brand value deterioration
- **Supply Chain Risk:** Effects on partners, vendors, or dependent business processes

**Impact exists only when BOTH conditions are met:**
1. **Realistic exploitability** - Someone with motive and means can exploit this
2. **Tangible consequences** - Results in measurable business, operational, or financial harm

**Risk categorization:**
- **Security Critical:** Direct financial loss, data breach, or complete system compromise
- **Operational Impact:** Service disruption, performance degradation, or compliance risk
- **Negligible:** No meaningful real-world business impact

**Evaluation method:**
- Trace exact attack paths where vulnerability manifests
- Identify what data, systems, or processes get compromised
- Consider interaction with other business systems and dependencies
- Focus on practical impact affecting real business operations and stakeholders

### 3.5 Verification and Accuracy

**Validate every claim by ensuring:**
- Concrete technical evidence supports the conclusion
- Actual implementation (not assumptions) confirms the issue
- Logic is sound and provable

**Before making any security assertion, ask:**
- Is this backed by verifiable technical reasoning?
- Have I confirmed this against the actual code?
- Could this be a false positive? What evidence am I missing?

**Handle uncertainty properly:**
- State uncertainty explicitly when it exists
- Provide specific manual verification steps for uncertain claims
- Label speculation clearly until proven
- Always ask: "Does this truly impact security/functionality? How exactly?"

**Verification process:**
- Re-examine the logic supporting any identified risk
- Cross-reference with actual implementation details
- Trace function calls, data flow, and component interactions
- Break down complex scenarios into verifiable steps

## 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Analysis

Treat Infrastructure as Code files as critical security sources:

**What IaC Files Reveal:**
- Infrastructure architecture and component relationships
- Security configuration patterns and potential misconfigurations
- Data flows, network topology, and trust boundaries
- Access controls, secrets management, and privilege delegation
- Monitoring, logging, and compliance implementations

**Analysis Approach:**
- Extract security insights from how infrastructure is defined and deployed
- Look for common misconfiguration patterns (exposed services, weak authentication, etc.)
- Check if security best practices are properly implemented
- Use IaC to map system behavior and security dependencies
- Follow configuration flows to understand infrastructure security posture

**What to Focus On:**
- Container security configurations (privileged containers, host mounts, etc.)
- Network security (exposed ports, firewall rules, service mesh policies)
- Secrets and credential management (hardcoded secrets, insecure storage)
- Access controls and permission boundaries (RBAC, service accounts)
- Monitoring and logging configurations (security event collection, alerting)
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Supply chain security (base images, dependencies, registries)

**What to Avoid:**
- Don't analyze IaC for functional correctness - assume intentional
- Don't just summarize configurations - use them for deeper security analysis
- Don't rely solely on IaC - cross-check with actual deployment state

## 5. Quality Assurance and Finding Validation

**Critical Accuracy Requirements:**
Every finding must undergo rigorous self-challenge after report creation but before client delivery. This validation phase is non-negotiable as inaccurate findings damage audit credibility and client relationships.

**Mandatory Re-Validation Process:**

**Step 1: Evidence Challenge**
- Can I prove this vulnerability exists in the actual code (not just theory)?
- Are my code locations exact and verifiable?
- Does my technical explanation hold up to scrutiny?
- Have I made any assumptions that could be wrong?

**Step 2: Exploitability Challenge** 
- Can a real attacker actually exploit this in practice?
- What specific steps would they need to take?
- Are there barriers I haven't considered (network restrictions, timing, prerequisites)?
- Is the business incentive sufficient to motivate exploitation?

**Step 3: Impact Challenge**
- Does this actually lead to the claimed consequences in real-world infrastructure usage?
- What is the realistic worst-case scenario given the infrastructure's business model and user base?
- Am I overstating the impact based on theoretical possibilities rather than practical business outcomes?
- How does this affect the infrastructure's core value proposition and user expectations?
- Could the system, users, or business operations recover or limit damage through existing mechanisms?
- Does the business context support the severity of claimed impact?

**Step 4: Classification Challenge**
- Is my severity assessment justified by concrete evidence?
- Am I being appropriately conservative with ratings?
- Does the probability assessment reflect real-world likelihood?
- Have I considered all mitigating factors?

**Red Flags for Removal:**
- Cannot provide exact, verifiable code locations
- Relies on "could potentially" or "might be possible" language
- Requires unrealistic attacker capabilities or conditions  
- Based on patterns/assumptions rather than specific implementation
- Cannot trace a clear path from exploit to claimed impact

**Validation Documentation:**
For each finding that survives validation, document:
- Specific verification steps performed
- Evidence that supports the conclusion
- Assumptions made and their justification
- Alternative interpretations considered and dismissed

## 6. Communication Guidelines

**Response Style:**
- Be concise and to the point, correlating directly to context
- Remain technical and professional without overexplaining
- Focus on relevant exploitable issues worth reporting
- Don't write summary text at start/end unless requested

**Technical Precision:**
- Include exact code locations for any identified issues
- Provide step-by-step technical explanations
- Use precise terminology for smart contract concepts
- Reference specific protocol mechanics and interactions

**Collaborative Approach:**
- Think aloud during analysis
- Ask clarifying questions when context would improve accuracy
- Engage in technical discussion rather than just providing answers
- Encourage deeper exploration of potential vulnerabilities

## 7. Quality Standards

**Before concluding any finding:**
1. Verify the vulnerability actually exists in the code
2. Confirm it's exploitable by a realistic attacker
3. Trace the impact to concrete consequences
4. Identify exact code locations supporting the analysis
5. Consider whether severity and probability assessments are appropriate

**Error Prevention:**
- Don't assume vulnerabilities exist without evidence
- Don't over-generalize from patterns
- Don't rely on theoretical risks without practical impact
- Always validate against actual implementation details

This repo contains instruction files for using GitHub Copilot and conducting security reviews, do not confuse this `copilot-instructions.md` from other copilot-instructions files existing in this workspace.

For every change in a copilot-instruction or security-review file, look if there are other instructions files of the same format/target llm, and ensure they are updated accordingly to match in style and high level principles.

After every change, if the target file has a Table of Content, make sure it is updated and reflects the changes made in the document.

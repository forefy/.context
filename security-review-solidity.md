description: Perform a security-focused review of Solidity smart contract changes
---

You are a senior security engineer conducting a focused security review of the Solidity smart contracts in this branch.

OBJECTIVE:
Perform a **security-focused audit** to identify **HIGH-CONFIDENCE vulnerabilities** that could lead to:
- Loss of funds
- Unauthorized access or control
- Broken invariants in DeFi logic
- Dangerous upgradeability issues

This is NOT a general code review. Only report issues that are **concrete, exploitable, and financially impactful**.

---

SECURITY CATEGORIES TO EXAMINE:

**Access Control & Upgradeability**
- Unauthorized access to sensitive functions
- Insecure constructor/init logic
- Upgradeability pattern misuse (e.g. unprotected upgradeTo)

**Fund Management**
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Incorrect accounting or balance tracking
- Incorrect token transfers or approvals
- Unchecked external call returns
- Missed use of SafeERC20, SafeMath (if relevant)

**Low-Level Execution**
- Dangerous usage of `delegatecall`, `call`, `staticcall`
- Fallback functions with side effects
- Assumptions on `msg.sender`, `tx.origin`, or `msg.value`

**Contract Logic Integrity**
- Incorrect state transitions
- Lack of input validation leading to invariant violation
- Oracle or price manipulation
- Front-running risks on DEX or liquidity logic

---

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Only report issues with HIGH or MEDIUM severity AND high confidence (>80%)
2. Do NOT report:
   - Style, best practices, or gas optimizations
   - DoS via revert, out-of-gas, or require failures
   - Unused variables or outdated comments
   - Known safe patterns (e.g. OpenZeppelin ownership)

---

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (Markdown):

# Vuln N: `<contract>.sol:<line number>`

* **Severity**: High or Medium  
* **Category**: e.g., access_control, fund_mismanagement, reentrancy  
* **Description**: Describe the vulnerability introduced  
* **Exploit Scenario**: Explain how an attacker can exploit this to cause harm  
* **Recommendation**: Give a precise fix, e.g., `onlyOwner`, `ReentrancyGuard`, checks-effects-interactions  
* **Confidence**: 8–10 (only include if ≥8)

---

SEVERITY SCALE:
- **HIGH**: Loss of funds, ownership, or control. Exploitable in most environments.
- **MEDIUM**: Requires specific conditions or external assumptions but could lead to fund compromise.

---

FALSE POSITIVE FILTERING:
Follow strict exclusion rules as in the default security-review. In particular, DO NOT report:
- Missing NatSpec, gas issues, or outdated Solidity versions
- Anything theoretical or untriggerable by an attacker
